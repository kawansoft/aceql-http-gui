<h2><font face="Arial">Trying The Enterprise Edition</h2><font face="Arial" size=4>

Transitioning from the default Community Edition to the Enterprise Edition simply requires a license file (there is no other installation to do):
<ul>
<li>Get a Trial License File at <a href="https://www.aceql.com/aceql-trial">www.aceql.com/aceql-trial</a>.
<li>You'll receive an email with the license file.
<li>Install the received <code>aceql-license-key.txt</code> license file in the <br> <code>&lt;Installation Directory&gt;/AceQL/lib-server/</code> subdirectory.
<li>Restart the AceQL Server.
</ul>

<h2><font face="Arial">Buying The Enterprise Edition </h2><font face="Arial" size=4>
 
When buying a license, the license is valid for one year and applies to up to 5 SQL database names. 
<br>
<br>There's no limitation to the number of computers installed. This means you're granted the right to access up to 5 databases from any computer. 
<br>
The <code>"my_company_sales"</code> database, for example, may be accessed by AceQL from your test server, your pre-production server and your production server.
