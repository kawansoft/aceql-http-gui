                 Version 1.0-beta-3
                    Release Notes


Introduction
------------

AceQL HTTP is a secure framework of REST like HTTP APIs that allow to 
access to remote SQL databases over HTTP from any device that supports HTTP. 

AceQL HTTP is provided with two client SDKs:
- The AceQL Java Client SDK allows to wrap the HTTP APIs using JDBC calls 
  in their code, just like they would for a local database.
- The AceQL C# Client SDK allows to wrap the HTTP APIs using Microsoft SQL 
  Server like calls in their code, just like they would for a local database.

Security has been taken into account from the design: It as allowed to specify 
and code strong security rules in order to protect the databases.
